# Dashboard / Analytics Screen

## Anatomy

A dashboard presents a high-level overview of key metrics and recent activity. Expected sections, top to bottom:

1. **Page header**: Title (heading3) + optional date range or period selector
2. **KPI counter row**: 3-5 counter tiles in a responsive grid (columns layout, 3-4 columns desktop). Each tile contains:
   - Icon or small graphic representing the metric
   - Large numeric value (heading2 or heading3 weight)
   - Label describing the metric
   - Optional trend indicator (up/down arrow + percentage change)
3. **Charts row**: 1-2 charts showing trends or distributions (bar, line, donut). Place in a 2-column layout or full-width depending on chart count
4. **Summary list**: Recent or top items (5-10 rows), sorted by recency or priority. Use a compact data table (TableRecords) or card list (List widget)
5. **Optional filter bar**: Date range selector, category dropdown, status filter — placed above the KPI row or in the header

## Layout

- Use `Columns2Section` / `Columns3Section` layout wrappers to arrange sections side-by-side. Without them, all sections stack vertically
- Counter tiles: wrap 3 counters in a `Columns3Section`, or 2 in a `Columns2Section` — so they appear as a row
- Charts: wrap 2 charts in a `Columns2Section` so they appear side-by-side
- Summary list: place as a flat section below the columns — it takes full width
- See the `VO_AddSalesDashboardWithChartAndAnonymousAccess` example for the exact code pattern

## Styling

- Counter tiles: card container with soft shadow, border-radius, and internal padding. Background neutral-0 or neutral-1. Icon on the left or top, value prominently sized
- Charts: card container with title heading and padding. Ensure minimum height for readability (~300px)
- Summary list: compact table with striping for readability, or card-based list items
- Trend indicators: semantic colors — green/success for positive, red/error for negative, neutral for flat
- Grid: use gutter-m or gutter-base between columns. Add phone-break-all for responsive stacking

## Data Patterns

- Each KPI counter needs its own data source (aggregate or data action) — do not share data sources between counters
- Charts need aggregated/grouped data — typically a separate data source per chart with appropriate grouping
- Summary list: sorted by date descending or by priority, limited to 5-10 rows (no pagination needed)
- Optional: auto-refresh timer or manual refresh button to keep data current

## How to Decide What to Show (when the prompt doesn't specify)

A dashboard is NOT just counters. You MUST include charts and a summary list even if the prompt only says "dashboard." Use the data model to decide:

1. **Counters**: One count per entity mentioned for the dashboard. If no entities mentioned, count the 3-5 most important entities in the app.
2. **Charts**: Examine each entity's attributes for groupable fields:
   - A `Status`, `State`, `Type`, `Category`, `Priority`, or `Level` attribute → Bar or Donut chart grouping records by that attribute's values
   - A `CreatedAt`, `Date`, `DueDate`, or datetime attribute → Line chart showing records over time (grouped by month/week)
   - Pick the 1-2 most meaningful groupings. Prefer Status-based charts (they show operational health)
3. **Summary list**: Pick the entity with a date/time attribute and show the 5-10 most recent records. Display: primary name/title + status + date + assigned user (if applicable). This gives users a "what happened recently" view.

## Responsive Behavior

- Desktop: 3-4 column KPI grid, 2-column charts, full-width summary
- Tablet: 2-column KPI grid, charts stack vertically
- Phone: single-column everything, charts full-width, summary list simplified
