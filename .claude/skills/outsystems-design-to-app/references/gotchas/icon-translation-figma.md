# Figma React sources use Lucide — translate to Phosphor

**The trap:** Most Figma-Make / Figma-React / shadcn-ui sources use [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) — rendered with `class="lucide lucide-<name>"` and an `<svg>` body. OutSystemsUI doesn't ship Lucide — it ships **Phosphor Icons**. If you carry Lucide class names verbatim into the spec, the icons render as raw `<svg>` (no glyph translation), and you've also re-introduced the SVG bake problem (see [`svg-icon-baking.md`](svg-icon-baking.md)).

**The fix:** translate each Lucide occurrence to its Phosphor equivalent in the spec.json. Don't try to add Lucide as a second library — too much theme integration work.

## Detection

```bash
grep -oE 'lucide lucide-[a-z-]+' /tmp/oml-source/rendered.html | sort -u
```

If you see any matches, the source is Lucide-based and you must translate each one.

If the source uses an icon not on this list, browse [phosphoricons.com](https://phosphoricons.com/) for the closest match. There are 1500+ Phosphor icons; almost everything Lucide has an equivalent.

## How to apply in the spec.json

For each Lucide icon in the source, the section's VISUAL LAYOUT description specifies the Phosphor equivalent — but remember that **`<i class="ph ph-X">` font icons DON'T render** in ODC's SPA runtime (see [`svg-icon-baking.md`](svg-icon-baking.md) §3). The agent should either:

1. Emit an **inline `<svg>`** with the Phosphor glyph's path data + explicit `fill` (white for dark containers).
2. OR use a **real OutSystemsUI Icon widget** with the bare Phosphor name as the `Icon` property (e.g., `Icon="squares-four"`, not `"ph-squares-four"` or `"ph ph-squares-four"`). The OutSystemsUI Icon widget handles the rendering; this is the preferred path when the source name maps cleanly.

In the `spec.json`'s `design_system.icon_mapping` field, record translations as a dict so Mentor can apply them consistently:

```json
"icon_mapping": {
  "lucide-layout-dashboard": "squares-four",
  "lucide-users": "users",
  "lucide-trending-up": "trend-up",
  ...
}
```

## Bonus: weight modifiers

The default Phosphor weight is `regular`. For thinner / bolder strokes:
- Thin: `ph-thin` modifier class
- Bold: `ph-bold`
- Fill: `ph-fill`

Pick the weight that matches the source's visual style.
